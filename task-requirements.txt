In the contacts list, the user should be able to toggle "favorite" on and off. If the contact was unfavorited, it should disappear from the list of favorite contacts.
You should be able to modify existing contact.
Tech stack:

  You can use the language of your choice.
  You can use the framework of your choice.
  You can use any libraries of your choice.

Things which we will care about are:

  The source code quality. It should be well formatted and easy to review
  The UI. The application should look nice (subjectively) and easy to use. Ideally mobile friendly.
  The form validation
  Commits quality - Commits titles should following angular commit conventions. And each logical task should be separate commit. 
  Configured linter would be welcome but not required
  Some unit tests are welcome but not required
  We expect you to finish the test assignment in one week but let us know if you want more time due to your availability.

Please, create GitHub or GitLab repository and share it with us once you are done with the assignment.

1. By commits quality we assume that you separate task by relevant commits with proper comments but not a for example single commit with everythingâ€‹ in it.

2. It is up to you but browser api would be enough. Please, provide README file with project details and steps required to install it.
